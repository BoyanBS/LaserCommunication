# LaserCommunication
Two microcontrollers communicating via a laser

The point of this project is to show how light can be used to transfer information. In this project we have two separate microcontrollers that communicate with a laser. The communication is very simple and slow to be honest, it's just a message in morse code.

For the project you will need:
1. One esp32 and one arduino (or two esp32s, in my case I didn't have)
2. 16X2 I2C LCD display
3. Photoresistor
4. Resistor (10 kOhms)
5. Laser diode
